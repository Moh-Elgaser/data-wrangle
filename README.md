# Wrangling-Doggo-Data
This is a project completed during Udacity's data analyst nanodegree. I will provide a brief summary of the files below.

__act_report.pdf__ is a written report of the insights that I had found in my analysis of WeRateDogs tweets.  
__image_predictions.tsv__ is a file that was provided by Udacity that has the dog breed predictions that were created from a neural network.  
__tweet_json.txt__ is a json file containing all of the data available returned from twitter's api.   
__twitter_archive_enhanced.csv__ is a csv file containing WeRateDogs tweet archive, but it contains a little more information.  
__twitter_archive_master.csv__ is the clean data file that I wrote all the data to after wrangling. It was  _all_ the data that was used for the analysis.  
__wrangle_act.ipynb__ is the jupyter notebook where I wrangled and analyzed all my data.   
__wrangle_report.pdf__ is a written report of my data wrangling efforts.  

It was only required that I clean two tidiness issues and eight tidiness issues. Obviously there are way more issues than that, perhaps I will return to this project in a little bit.
